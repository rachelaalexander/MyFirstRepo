            <h1> This is Emmi's Story</h1>
            <p> This is a story all about how my life got flipped turn upside down. So I'd like to take a moment, just sit right there. I'll tell you how Emmi became the princess of Austin, Texas.</p>
            <p> I adopted Emmi from APA! when she was 4 months old. She was so small and had one hear that stood up straight and one that flopped. She had the greenest eyes and wanted to snuggle and play with toys all day. She's 2.5 years old now and not much has changed. She's grown into a beautiful, big-eared dog who loves her family, toys, and treats. She's the best friend in the world!</p>
